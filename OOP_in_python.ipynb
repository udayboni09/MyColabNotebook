At first glance a class seems a lot like a dictionary.  We will soon see how it's different.\n","\n","## Attributes\n","\n","A variable inside a class is called an *attribute.*\n","\n","## Methods\n","\n","How is this different than a list or dictionary?\n","\n","You can also have functions inside of a class.  You call a function that is inside of a class a *method*\n","\n","These functions can perform calculations on the attributes or on data fed to them from outside of the class.\n","\n","In the declaration of a class you can only define methods.  If you want to declare an attribute this must be done inside a method.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","## Objects\n","\n","An *object* is an instance of a particular class.\n","\n","For example, one existing data type in python is int\n","\n","If I define a variable as\n","first_int = 6\n","\n","Then first_int is an object of the type int\n","\n","I can also define\n","second_int = 532\n","\n","This is another instance of the type int\n","\n","These two instances of the type int have different values assigned to them!\n","\n","Similarly I can define my own type of variable as a class called My_data_type, then I can declare multiple objects of the class My_data_type, each having different names and possibly having different values assigned to their attributes and different execution of the methods.  We have to name the data type (int), but we also have to name each instance of the data type (first_int, second_int).\n","\n","This will all become clear when we do an example.\n","\n","## Initializer\n","\n","If you want to assign some attribute values to your object when you declare it we use an *initializer* in the class definition.  We can also automatically run other methods from inside the initializer at the time of declaration.\n","\n","## self\n","\n","self is an important concept for classes.  self is python's internal reference identifier for classes. It serves 2 main purposes.\n","\n","1) When you add an attribute (variable) in a class you must name it self.attribute_name.  Then when you declare an object of that class you access that attribute from the outside as object_name.attribute_name, or if you want to use it interally in a method you would reference it as self.attribute_name.\n","\n","2) When you add a method (function) to a class, you *must* have self as the first argument of that function. but when you call a function you don't actually input self... this is a little confusing.\n","\n","### Let's look at an example"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"fpt1yU1q0pSD","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1729946113656,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":254,"user":{"displayName":"Uday Boni","userId":"04432828784263155364"}},"outputId":"d212b70d-4b35-49d9-ce50-0290a9efbb14"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["1.7\n","3.74\n"]}],"source":["# the name of the data type (class) must always start with a capital letter\n","\n","class My_data_type:  #
